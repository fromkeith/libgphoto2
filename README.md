This Fork
---------

This fork gets libgphoto2 building for android.



### Differences:
	- Added an android_init function to libusb1.
	- Added gp_android_init_port to gphoto2 so we can pass through the file descriptor of the usb port.
	- Port library's are linked against math ('m'). Otherwise we crash at runtime...
 	- Changed the libusb open call to use a modified version of libusb
		- See: https://github.com/martinmarinov/rtl_tcp_andro-
		- Locally the make file here was modify to change the library name to libusb-1.0.so
    - See android_examples/
		- for some really rough JNI bridge code

### Extra File
	- build_android.sh
		- Configures the build for armeabi
		- Be sure to change the paths to your libusb location, and ndk locations.
	- make_android.sh
		- makes and installs the library
		- Be sure to change the paths as necessary.

### Extra work required
	- The .so files that get output are versioned... android doesn't like this.
		- This will help you fix the shared libraries so they can be loaded by android
```		
		rpl -R -e libgphoto2.so.6 "libgphoto2.so\x00\x00" kbin/lib/libgphoto2.so
		rpl -R -e libgphoto2_port.so.12 "libgphoto2_port.so\x00\x00\x00" kbin/lib/libgphoto2.so
		rpl -R -e libgphoto2_port.so.12 "libgphoto2_port.so\x00\x00\x00" kbin/lib/libgphoto2_port.re.so
``

	- The camera and port libraries that get output aren't prefixed with 'lib'... android doesn't like this.
		- They also reference the versioned shared libraries...
```
		rpl -R -e libgphoto2.so.6 "libgphoto2.so\x00\x00" kbin/lib/libgphoto2/2.5.10/libptp2.so
		rpl -R -e libgphoto2_port.so.12 "libgphoto2_port.so\x00\x00\x00" kbin/lib/libgphoto2/2.5.10/libptp2.so
		rpl -R -e libgphoto2_port.so.12 "libgphoto2_port.so\x00\x00\x00" kbin/lib/libgphoto2_port/0.12.0/libusb1.so
```

### Output
	- Put the shared libraries into your android project - jni- libs...
		- libgphoto2.so
		- libgphoto2_port.so
		- libptp2.so
		- libusb-1.0.so
		- libusb1.so
	- In your JNI native code you need to set the following environment variables
		- IOLIBS
		- CAMLIBS
		- Both of this environemnt variables will need to point to your apk's arm libs folder.

### Other notes
	- Yes, there are probably more elagant ways to get this library working... but hey..
	- Libusb doesn't seem to properly get the descriptor and configuration of usbs on android.
		- This can instead be done using JNI to call android.
		- That will allow you to see which cams are supported.
	- GPL of course...
	- libtool from here
